# mapr-utils
Collection of random stuff
 - find_by_id.py - sample DAG client for the yelp dataset
 - setup-cluster.sh - sets up volumes and db tables for the yelp dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download ) - note that this needs the yelp data somewhere locally as it's too big to add to github.
 - mapr_dev_sandbox_setup.sh - edited the container for developers (https://mapr.com/docs/61/MapRContainerDevelopers/RunMapRContainerDevelopers.html) to map the DAG port (5678).
